# ChessTrainer
### Purpose
<p>The end goal of this project is to develop a single player chess engine that will allow the user to quickly practice chess oppenings by utilizing stockfish to determine the best move. It will do this by automatically re-setting the board when the user doesnt play a main-line move against the engine</p>
